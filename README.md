# Virtual Keyboard

In this **SPW** (single-page-website) I used **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create an interesting keyboard with typing effects and
key-sounds that allows you to experience virtual typing.

Feel free to take a look at the source code and give it an update, in case you're intereseted.
